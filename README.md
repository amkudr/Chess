# Chess
This project is a C++ implementation of a Chess engine that includes different classes representing chess pieces, board movement logic, and game state management.

Features
Chess Pieces: Each chess piece (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn) has its own class with movement logic.\
Move Validation: The engine checks for valid moves according to standard chess rules.\
Custom Exceptions: Handling of exceptions related to invalid moves or game state errors.\
Priority Queue: Implemented for managing move ordering and optimization.

Usage
Run the executable after building the project: ```
./chess-engine```
